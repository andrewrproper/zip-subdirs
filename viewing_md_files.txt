VIEWING MARKDOWN FILES (.md)

To view markdown (.md) files, you can install a web 
browser plugin such as "Markdown Preview Plus" for Chrome.

With Chrome, you then have to go to Tools -> Extensions
and check "Allow access to file URLs" for the plugin.

After that, you can open a new tab in Chrome and drag and 
drop the .md file onto the tab. It will render it as an
HTML page, with headings and links styled.  

You can also install a program such as Pandoc to 
convert markdown files to other formats, such as HTML.
