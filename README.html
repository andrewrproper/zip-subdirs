<h1 id="zip-subdirs-version-0.1.0">Zip Subdirs Version 0.1.0</h1>
<p>February 15, 2016</p>
<p><em>Copyright <a href="https://endosynth.wordpress.com/">Andrew Proper</a> 2016.</em></p>
<p>Tested on Windows 7, 8, 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://endosynth.wordpress.com/category/zip-subdirs/">Zip-Subdirs News Online</a></p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>First install <a href="http://dwimperl.com">DWIMPerl</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This was tested with <a href="http://dwimperl.com">DWIMPerl</a> v5.14.2.1 v7 32 bit for Windows.</li>
<li>If you cant get <a href="http://dwimperl.com">DWIMPerl</a>, Strawberry Perl may work.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that is installed, you can run the <code>zip-subdirs</code> shortcut to start. If the shortcut fails, try running the <code>zip-subdirs.bat</code> batch file.</p>
<p>If you have problems, try running <code>zip-subdirs-debug.bat</code> to see any debug or error output (in the black command prompt window).</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>Allows the user to select a directory, then displays the list of subdirectories under that directory. The user can select one or more (Ctrl-click) subdirectories to zip, then press the Zip button.</p>
<p>Subdirectories will be zipped in the order they are listed. Each one will be zipped into a timestamped zip file. Insize the zip file, the top-level item will be the subdirectory with a timestamp appended.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
<p>First, select a parent directory using the &quot;Browse&quot; button. This should then display a list of sub-directories in the text area below the &quot;Browse&quot; button. These are directories inside of the parent directory.</p>

</div>
<p>Next, select one or more sub-directories to copy into archive zip files. You can select only one, or some, or all of them.</p>
<p>After that, click the &quot;create a zip of each selected path&quot; button. Results of zipping will be shown in the bottom text area. Directories will be zipped one by one. Each resulting zip file will have a timestamp added to the end of the file name, and will contain the zipped directory with the timestamp added to the end of its name.</p>

<p>The timestamps make this useful for backing up timestamped zips of directories. They are also helpful for extracting/unzipping, because when you extract the zip file with paths enabled, the top directory will have a timestamp on it. This way, you can archive the same directory multiple times, and extract the archives, without the extracted archives overiting each others' directories.</p>
<p>This screenshot shows a resulting zip file opened in 7zip.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>The config file is <code>connfig.yaml</code>. It is a plain text file and can be editing with Notepad, gVim, etc.</p>
<p>It is in <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> format, which is white space sensitive. So don't change the white space, only change the values.</p>
<p>The following options exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>get_tree_du_max_ms : 5000
<ul>
<li>this is how long, in milliseconds, to wait to load disk usage per subdirectory. If loading takes too long, it will be stopped and a &quot;+&quot; sign will be shown beside the shown directory size.</li>
<li>the value, 5000, means 5000 milliseconds, or 0.5 seconds.</li>
<li>some computers are faster at loading disk usage than others.</li>
<li>if your computer is slow to load the subdirectories list, change this to a smaller number to speed up the loading.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compiling-to-exe">Compiling to Exe</h2>
<p>You will need to install the <strong>PAR::Packer</strong> CPAN module into DWIMPerl, using its cpan interface. This basically involves opening a Windows command prompt and running:</p>
<pre><code>cpan
&gt; install PAR::Packer</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can run <code>compile_to_exe.bat</code> to create a .exe file from the .pl file.</p>
<p>Note that this essentially just creates a zip of the perl code which can extract and run itself. It may not be better or faster than running the .pl file directly via its .bat file.</p>
